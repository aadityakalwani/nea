current issues:
- in Interop.ADOX, i have been unable to change the Change Embed Interop Types to False

immediate future ideas:
- 'lessons' where the player can learn about business and economics
    - lessons give:
        - a 'multiplier' to the player's income
        - increased storage capacity
        - diamonds
- history of properties upon click - databases and stuff
- label for the costs of upgrading storage

future ideas:
- more resources to buy and sell
- storage buildings like in COC to store resources
- quarry to mine stone
- plantation to grow food
- weather that affects the market prices / village visitors
- commission / charge for converting resources
- path tiles to connect properties to the town hall
- upgradable town hall
- upgradable properties
- use correct accessors and mutators
- idea of villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
- tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
- events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
