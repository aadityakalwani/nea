test if the refreshing of market data is working on every new day

current issues:
- the panel label should update whenever a new item is selected/toggled

future ideas:
- events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
- more resources
- history of properties upon click - databases and stuff
- path tiles to connect properties to the town hall
- general balance changes
- idea of 'villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
- upgradable tile size of the map
- ability to sell a property (for 80% of the price)
- 'teaching' mode where the player can learn about business and economics
- tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
- upgrade storage capacity
- separate UI items for things like market to make things look better

- copy other ideas from GoldDiggerzz
