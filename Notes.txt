future ideas:

    - more resources to buy and sell
        - quarry to mine stone

    - allow the Apply Prims to auto-put-in path tiles
    - idea of villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
    - storage buildings like in COC to store resources
    - weather that affects the market prices / village visitors
    - commission / charge for converting resources
    - path tiles to connect properties to the town hall
    - upgradable town hall
    - reformat the initializePrices so that it doesn't need the listOfAllProperties
    - tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
    - events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
