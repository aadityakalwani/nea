current issues:
- code to delete a property form the database when you sell it
- upgrading storage costs nothing

immediate future ideas:
- create a path tile to connect properties to the town hall
- allow the Apply Prims to auto-put-in path tiles

- 'lessons' where the player can learn about business and economics
    - lessons give:
        - a 'multiplier' to the player's income
        - increased storage capacity
        - diamonds

- 'gold storage updated' and other message boxes should auto-close after a few seconds
- history of properties upon click
- label for the costs of upgrading storage

future ideas:
- more resources to buy and sell
    - quarry to mine stone
- upgradable properties
- idea of villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
- storage buildings like in COC to store resources
- weather that affects the market prices / village visitors
- commission / charge for converting resources
- path tiles to connect properties to the town hall
- upgradable town hall
- tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
- events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
