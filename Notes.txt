current issues:
- you can spam 'new day' button to get infinite money - add in a timer?

immediate future ideas:
- more resources
- rename tabPages to something more descriptive
- organise code out more  as the file is very long - use other files?
- ability to sell a property (for 80% of the price)
- 'lessons' where the player can learn about business and economics
- history of properties upon click - databases and stuff

future ideas:
- path tiles to connect properties to the town hall
- upgradable storage capacity by completing 'lessons'
- upgradable village size by completing 'lessons'
- idea of villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
- tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
- events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
