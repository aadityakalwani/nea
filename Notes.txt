current issues:

- reformat the initializePrices so that it doesn't need the listOfAllProperties

- reverse the sort of the sortedProperties lol i want it to sort by most income, not least

immediate future ideas:

    - proper gets and sets on line 347 in form1.cs

    - create a path tile to connect properties to the town hall
        - if a property is not connected to the town hall then it cannot provide income (bool connected = false)
    - allow the Apply Prims to auto-put-in path tiles

    - fluctuating prices for the cost of building properties
    - fluctuating income for each property

future ideas:
    - more resources to buy and sell
        - quarry to mine stone
    - idea of villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
    - storage buildings like in COC to store resources
    - weather that affects the market prices / village visitors
    - commission / charge for converting resources
    - path tiles to connect properties to the town hall
    - upgradable town hall
    - tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
    - events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
