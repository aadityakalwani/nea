current issues:

- sort by ID number for a property

- when sorting, the propertiesArray is being sorted, not the data in the database table itself
    - as a result, 'sorting' does nothing (nothing visible to the user)
        - so I need to sort the data in the database table itself
        - or overwrite the database data with the sorted array?

- code to delete a property form the database when you sell it
    - alternatively a boolean to state if the property is active/sold or not

immediate future ideas:

    - 'lessons' where the player can learn about business and economics
        - lessons give:
            - a 'multiplier' to the player's income
            - increased storage capacity
            - diamonds

    - create a path tile to connect properties to the town hall
        - if a property is not connected to the town hall then it cannot provide income (bool connected = false)
    - allow the Apply Prims to auto-put-in path tiles

    - history of properties upon click

future ideas:
    - more resources to buy and sell
        - quarry to mine stone
    - upgradable properties
    - idea of villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
    - storage buildings like in COC to store resources
    - weather that affects the market prices / village visitors
    - commission / charge for converting resources
    - path tiles to connect properties to the town hall
    - upgradable town hall
    - tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
    - events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
