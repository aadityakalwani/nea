current issues:

immediate future ideas:

    - add a way to see the current lesson ID when performing a lesson

    - create a text file that has all 100 lessons in it and then pull data from the text file into the database rather than having to manually input all 100 lessons

    - create a path tile to connect properties to the town hall
            - if a property is not connected to the town hall then it provides half of the income (bool connected = false)
            - allow the Apply Prims to auto-put-in path tiles

    - commission / charge for converting resources that fluctuates

future ideas:

    - weather that affects the market prices / village visitors

way-far-future ideas:

    - more resources to buy and sell
        - quarry to mine stone
    - idea of villagers or visitors to the town that effect the market prices
    - storage buildings like in COC to store resources
    - upgradable town hall
    - reformat the initializePrices so that it doesn't need the listOfAllProperties
    - tutorial / introduction to the game upon start
    - events that affect the market prices such as stock market crashes or booms
